# Bayesian-for-BOLD
This experiment will focus on developing simulations for blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data that serve as the ground truth for Computational Parametric Mapping (CPM), a Bayesian approach for model-based fMRI experiments.

## Background 
<img align = "right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EstellaD/Bayesian-for-BOLD/master/img/introBOLD.png" width=700> 
The functional biological process is generated by a stimuli at the finger tip, through many neural pathways and the activation of the hemoglobin response function to manifest as signals in the brain imaging [1].

For functional MRI, there are two experiment designs, as indicated below [2]. A block design gives constant stimulus for a period of time, followed by no stimulus for a while. On the contrary, event related design applies point stimulus, and the resulting BOLD signals over time are voxels in each fMRI image.

During the second last step, the BOLD function is generated. It has a initial dip followed by a peak and then a post stimulus undershoot [3]. Given the shape of one single BOLD signal curve, we can approximate it with a inverse gamma distribution. There are two steps for the Bayesian framework: 
1. First:  Chose a prior. In the current simulation, we chose a conjugate (flat/uninformative) prior for the inverse gamma distribution
2. Second

## Running the simulation code

#### Requirements
This repository is implemented in MATLAB 3.7, with several dependency functions from [Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)] (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) package developed by UCL for neuroimging. 

#### Explanation of the file structure
`StarOneBeta.m` contains all visualization of the MAP of different power values. 
`Efficiency.m`
`Effnojitter.m`

## Result
While in general, the proposed approach can successfully recover all powers (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha"/> value) selected, the neurometric power with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha"/> = 1.5 gives the best recovery rate.
